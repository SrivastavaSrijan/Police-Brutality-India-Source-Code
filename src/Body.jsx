          On June 19th 2020, P Jayaraj (59) and his son Fenix (31), residents of
          Tuticorin were picked up for questioning by the cops in the
          Sathankulam police force for violating lockdown rules. The police said
          that the duo kept their mobile shop open during the lockdown. They
          were tortured, raped, and then brutally murdered by the police while
          in holding. They were taken to an area with no CCTV coverage and were
          beaten and sodomized with iron tipped lathis (batons). On June 22nd,
          Fenix died of his injuries and his father died the following day.
